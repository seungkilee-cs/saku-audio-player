# Fix Log â€” 2025-10-02

## Summary
- **Metadata loader** Parallelized track metadata fetching, normalized field names (e.g., `codec`), and improved formatting in `src/assets/meta/tracks.js`.
- **Playback UX** Hardened duration handling and styling in `src/components/AudioPlayer.jsx` and `src/components/ProgressBar.jsx`, plus enhanced slider accessibility.
- **Keyboard scope** Restricted arrow key shortcuts to focused controls in `src/components/AudioControls.jsx` and `src/components/VolumeControl.jsx`.
- **Cleanup** Removed obsolete files `src/components/package.json`, `src/components/Volume.jsx`, and `util/static-track-list-generator.js`.
- **Dependency security** Upgraded `react-router-dom` to `^7.5.3`, bumped `vite` to `^7.1.8`, and updated `@vitejs/plugin-react` to `^4.3.2` in `package.json` to resolve audit findings.

## Files Changed
- `src/assets/meta/tracks.js`
- `src/components/AudioPlayer.jsx`
- `src/components/ProgressBar.jsx`
- `src/components/AudioControls.jsx`
- `src/components/VolumeControl.jsx`
- `package.json`

## Notes
- Removing `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json` before reinstalling is optional but helpful when dependency trees change significantly; this project currently has no lockfile, so a fresh `npm install` after editing `package.json` is sufficient.
- Running `npm install` now requires Vite v7-compatible Node (>=18.3); ensure your environment meets Vite's engine requirements.
- Removed: `src/components/package.json`
- Removed: `src/components/Volume.jsx`
- Removed: `util/static-track-list-generator.js`

## Validation
- Tests not run (none defined). Recommend executing `npm run build` or adding automated tests to verify playback flows.
