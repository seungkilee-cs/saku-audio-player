# Phase 0 · Step 3 — outputLatency Baseline

## Issue
- During Phase 0 we attempted to run `audioContext.outputLatency` from DevTools and hit `ReferenceError: audioContext is not defined`.
- The SPA does not instantiate an `AudioContext` until the PEQ graph is created (Phase 1) due to autoplay policies and lazy initialization.

## Decision
- Skip the latency measurement in Phase 0.
- Move the `outputLatency` check to Phase 1 once the real `AudioContext` exists and the PEQ chain is wired.

## Rationale
- Creating a throwaway `AudioContext` in Phase 0 would not reflect the player’s actual audio pipeline and could mislead baseline metrics.
- Measuring after Phase 1 ensures we capture latency introduced by the real graph (preamp + filters) while still enabling before/after comparisons as the EQ evolves.

## Next Steps
- Update `docs/peq-implementation-plan.md` to note that the latency baseline occurs in Phase 1.
- When Phase 1 is complete, record `audioContext.outputLatency` alongside CPU usage for the new graph and store results in `docs/notes/peq-baseline.md`.
