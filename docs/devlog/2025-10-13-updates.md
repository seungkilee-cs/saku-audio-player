# Oct 13 2025 Updates

## Equalizer panel
- Added repeat and shuffle controls to the audio player header integration with PlaybackContext
- Converted preset cycling helpers in `src/components/PeqPanel.jsx` to `useCallback` and wired into keyboard shortcuts
- Removed unused keyboard shortcut state and ensured `useKeyboardShortcuts` runs without capturing `shortcuts`

## Audio player layout
- Reworked spacing and sizing inside `src/styles/AudioPlayer.css` to better use vertical area
- Restored uniform control button dimensions for light and dark themes
- Added narrow width media query to shrink art, text, and controls without truncation
- Styled repeat and shuffle buttons with pastel gradients for both themes

## Panel access and overlays
- Reduced sidebar toggle icon hover feedback to color only so the button stays in place
- Initialized sidebars closed under 1280 width and close them on resize in `src/components/layout/AppLayout.jsx`
- Increased overlay stacking order and blur settings so mobile panels appear above the backdrop in `src/styles/AppLayout.css`

## Header adjustments
- Softened hover animation on header quick action buttons in `src/styles/Header.css`
- Removed unused theme variable in `src/components/layout/Header.jsx`

## Lint cleanup
- Cleared unused variables across `PeqPanel.jsx`, `PresetImportExport.jsx`, and `PresetLibrary.jsx`
- Deleted unused drag handlers in `PresetImportExport.jsx`
- Updated imports so eslint passes without warnings
