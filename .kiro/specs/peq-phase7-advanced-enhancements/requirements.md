# Phase 7: Advanced PEQ Enhancements - Requirements

## Overview
Phase 7 focuses on power user features that elevate the PEQ system from functional to professional-grade. This phase implements clipping monitoring, keyboard shortcuts, and extended format support.

## User Stories

### US7.1: Clipping Monitor
**As a** audio enthusiast  
**I want** real-time clipping detection and visual feedback  
**So that** I can prevent audio distortion and optimize my EQ settings  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] AnalyserNode monitors output for peaks exceeding 0 dBFS
- [ ] Visual indicator flashes/highlights when clipping occurs
- [ ] Monitor works even with preamp compensation
- [ ] Indicator resets when clipping stops
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (<1% CPU)

### US7.2: Keyboard Shortcuts
**As a** power user  
**I want** keyboard shortcuts for common EQ operations  
**So that** I can quickly adjust settings without mouse interaction  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] 'B' key toggles EQ bypass
- [ ] Arrow keys cycle through presets (Left/Right or Up/Down)
- [ ] 'R' key resets to flat EQ
- [ ] Shortcuts work globally when audio player has focus
- [ ] Shortcuts don't interfere with text input fields
- [ ] Visual feedback shows shortcut activation

### US7.3: Extended Format Support
**As a** user with different audio equipment  
**I want** to export presets in PowerAmp and Qudelix formats  
**So that** I can use my EQ settings across different applications  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] PowerAmp XML format export
- [ ] Qudelix JSON format export  
- [ ] Format selection in export UI
- [ ] Proper frequency/gain mapping for each format
- [ ] Validation of exported files

### US7.4: Enhanced User Experience
**As a** user  
**I want** polished interactions and feedback  
**So that** the EQ feels professional and responsive  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Smooth animations for state changes
- [ ] Consistent visual feedback across all controls
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Performance remains optimal

## Technical Requirements

### TR7.1: Audio Analysis
- Implement AnalyserNode for real-time peak detection
- Sample rate: Match audio context (typically 44.1kHz)
- Buffer size: 2048 samples for balance of accuracy/performance
- Update frequency: 60 FPS for smooth visual feedback

### TR7.2: Event Handling
- Global keyboard event listeners
- Event delegation to prevent conflicts
- Focus management for text inputs
- Cleanup on component unmount

### TR7.3: Format Conversion
- PowerAmp XML schema compliance
- Qudelix JSON structure matching
- Frequency band mapping algorithms
- Error handling for unsupported configurations

### TR7.4: Performance
- Clipping monitor: <1% CPU overhead
- Keyboard shortcuts: <1ms response time
- Format conversion: <100ms for typical presets
- No memory leaks from event listeners

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Clipping detection accuracy: >99% for peaks >0 dBFS
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut response: <50ms perceived delay
- [ ] Export compatibility: Files work in target applications
- [ ] Performance regression: <5% CPU increase from baseline
- [ ] User satisfaction: Smooth, professional feel

## Dependencies
- Existing PEQ system (Phases 1-6)
- Web Audio API AnalyserNode support
- File download capabilities
- Keyboard event handling

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: AnalyserNode performance impact
  **Mitigation**: Optimize buffer size and update frequency
- **Risk**: Keyboard shortcuts conflict with browser/OS
  **Mitigation**: Use preventDefault() and focus detection
- **Risk**: Format compatibility issues
  **Mitigation**: Test with actual target applications

## Out of Scope
- Spectrum analyzer visualization (future phase)
- MIDI controller support
- Cloud preset synchronization
- Advanced clipping prevention algorithms
